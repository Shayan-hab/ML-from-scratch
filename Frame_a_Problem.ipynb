    "# 🧩 How to Frame a Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Framing a problem is the **first and most crucial step** in any Machine Learning (ML) project.  \n",
    "It means understanding **what you want to achieve**, **why it matters**, and **how ML can help** solve it effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1️⃣ Business Problem → ML Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building a model, translate the **real-world business challenge** into a **machine learning task**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Business problem: “Can we predict which customers will leave our service?”\n",
    "- ML problem: “Build a classification model to predict customer churn (Yes/No).”\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Always define:\n",
    "- What is the **goal**?  \n",
    "- What **data** do we have or can collect?  \n",
    "- What is the **expected outcome** (prediction, recommendation, etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ Types of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your objective, ML problems can be grouped as:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Classification** | Predict categories or labels | Spam vs Non-Spam email |\n",
    "| **Regression** | Predict continuous values | Predict house price |\n",
    "| **Clustering** | Group similar data points | Customer segmentation |\n",
    "| **Recommendation** | Suggest items | Movie recommendations |\n",
    "| **Anomaly Detection** | Find unusual patterns | Credit card fraud detection |\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Identifying the type of problem helps you select the **right algorithm and evaluation metric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Current Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand **how the problem is solved today** (if at all).  \n",
    "This helps you set a **benchmark** for your ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask:**\n",
    "- Is there a manual or rule-based process currently used?  \n",
    "- What are its **limitations**?  \n",
    "- How much **improvement** would justify switching to ML?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Getting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is only as good as its data. Collect data that represents the **real-world scenario**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources:**\n",
    "- Company databases  \n",
    "- Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI)  \n",
    "- APIs, Web scraping  \n",
    "- IoT devices or sensors  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Tip:** Ensure your data is **relevant, reliable, and ethically collected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ Metrics to Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "Define how you’ll know if your model is **successful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem Type | Common Metrics |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Classification | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score |\n",
    "| Regression | MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² |\n",
    "| Clustering | Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index |\n",
    "| Recommendation | Precision@K, MAP, NDCG |\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Choose metrics that align with the **business goal** — not just technical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Online vs Batch Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Use Case |\n",
    "|------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Online Learning** | Model updates continuously as new data arrives | Stock price prediction, real-time recommendations |\n",
    "| **Batch Learning** | Model trained periodically on a static dataset | Monthly sales forecasting, churn analysis |\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ Choose based on **data flow** and **update frequency** of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Check Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into training, **validate your assumptions** about:\n",
    "- Data availability and quality  \n",
    "- Relationships between features and target variable  \n",
    "- Stationarity or distribution assumptions (for time series)  \n",
    "- Feasibility of the ML approach  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 This step saves time and prevents model failure later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Framing the problem correctly ensures your ML project:\n",
    "- Solves the **right** question  \n",
    "- Uses **relevant** data and metrics  \n",
    "- Aligns with **business objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧠 A well-framed problem is already half-solved in machine learning.\n"
