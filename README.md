# ML-from-Scratch
My personal journey of learning Machine Learning, includes all the basic concepts, definitions, and Python code implementations that helped me understand ML step by step.

## 1. ðŸ§  Tensors in Machine Learning
This Jupyter Notebook explains the concept of **tensors** â€” the core data structure used in machine learning and deep learning.

### Contents
- A clear **definition** and **conceptual explanation** of tensors  
- **Dimensional examples** (scalar, vector, matrix, tensor)  
- Python code

## 2. ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)
This section provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the entire process used in this project, from data exploration to model training and visualization. A flowchart has been created to provide a clearer understanding of the overall process.

## 3. ðŸ§© How to Frame a Problem
In this notebook, we learned how to frame a real-world business problem into a Machine Learning problem by understanding its type, existing solutions, required data, evaluation metrics, and assumptions.

## 4. ðŸ“Š Data Gathering

This section explains how to collect and manage data for machine learning projects using different sources â€” **CSV files**, **JSON/SQL databases**, **APIs** and **Web Scraping**.
It demonstrates how data is imported, processed, and prepared for analysis to build a strong foundation for model development.

## 5. ðŸ§  Understanding Your Data  
This section focuses on exploring and analyzing datasets to uncover patterns, detect data quality issues, and prepare meaningful insights before model building.  
Understanding your data is the foundation of every successful machine learning project.
Univariate EDA focuses on analyzing and visualizing each variable individually to understand its distribution, patterns, and outliers.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis.
