# ML-from-Scratch
My personal journey of learning Machine Learning, includes all the basic concepts, definitions, and Python code implementations that helped me understand ML step by step.

## 1. ðŸ§  Tensors in Machine Learning
This Jupyter Notebook explains the concept of **tensors** â€” the core data structure used in machine learning and deep learning.

### Contents
- A clear **definition** and **conceptual explanation** of tensors  
- **Dimensional examples** (scalar, vector, matrix, tensor)  
- Python code

## 2. ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)
This section provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the entire process used in this project, from data exploration to model training and visualization.

## 3. ðŸ§© How to Frame a Problem
In this notebook, we learned how to frame a real-world business problem into a Machine Learning problem by understanding its type, existing solutions, required data, evaluation metrics, and assumptions.

## 4. ðŸ“Š Data Gathering

This section explains how to collect and manage data for machine learning projects using different sources â€” **CSV files**, **JSON/SQL databases**, **APIs** and **Web Scraping**
It demonstrates how data is imported, processed, and prepared for analysis to build a strong foundation for model development.
